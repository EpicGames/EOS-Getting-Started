## Requirements

The solution in this repository is a C++ Unreal Engine project targetting version 5.1. The code should be compatible with UE versions 4.27 and later. To build the project you will need a source or binary build of Unreal Engine. You will also need to have set up Visual Studio for working with Unreal Engine C++ project. See [Setting Up Visual Studio](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine/). **If you are using P2P, you should use UE 5.3 or upgrade the EOS SDK version in older UE versions to at least 1.16. See [Upgrading the EOS SDK](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/upgrading-the-eos-sdk-in-unreal-engine/). Older versions of the EOS SDK have this [WebRTC vulnerability](https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/s/news/eos-news-article-MCVDBTZSVM7VAJHF4ZGJVXZM52I4?language=en_US).**

## Usage

To compile and run the project, follow these steps:

1. If you're using a source build of Unreal Engine, build your engine. 
2. In the root folder, right-click on the .uproject file and select "Generate Visual Studio Project Files". 
3. Open the solution in Visual Studio, and build it. 

**The course is a walkthrough on how this code was written.**
