This repository contains the source code that accompanies the course: [Epic Games Store Mobile - The Online Subsystem EOS Plugin](link to course). The course walks you through the minimum features needed to publish a game with in-app purchases on the Epic Games Store Mobile. 

## Requirements

This project is a C++ Unreal Engine project with blueprints. The code was generated from targeting ue5-main in December 2025. The code should be compatible with older versions of UE5, though you will need to back port [this commit](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/commit/8ad9b7cf94cd964b01397cee386ff4657b7008a3) as the project depends on it. Once UE 5.8 is released, this code will be compatible with a binary build from the launcher.

## Usage

To compile and run the project, follow these steps:
1. In the root folder, right-click on the .uproject file and select "Generate Visual Studio Project Files". 
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio, and build it.

## Closed Beta
The mobile Epic Games Store is currently in closed beta. We’re excited to launch our self-publishing tools in the near future
